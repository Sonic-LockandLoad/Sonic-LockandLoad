### *Sonic: Lock & Load* is a hyper-fast character-action first-person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games and built on GZDoom.

It draws inspiration from Sonic games, as well as titles like Sonic Robo Blast 2, ULTRAKILL and DOOM Eternal. It also features elements from other GZDoom mods, retro FPS games and other character-action games.

Sonic: Lock & Load is not fully completed yet, and development is progressing slowly. However, it aims to provide an extremely fun and thrilling experience reminiscent of old-school shooters, as well as their modern-day revivals.

The current stable version of Sonic: Lock & Load is **v1.3.3**, though it's recommended you play the **v1.4 Final Final Demo** instead. Well, that's what I would be saying if the Final Final Demo wasn't already super outdated. I would say it's recommended to `git clone` the repo and play that, buuuuuuuuut yeah that's not gonna be very stable. I suggest you just wait for v1.4 "Horizons" to come out.

**Have any suggestions for or problems with the mod?** Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/issues/new/choose), it'll probably be resolved soon if possible.

To play an unstable version of S:L&L, use `git clone` to clone it to your computer, and open the cloned repo with GZDoom, like you would with a WAD or PK3. You can update with `git pull`. **Unstable versions contain unfinished stuff, the latest demo is recommended.**

GitHub shows C# and C++ as Sonic: Lock & Load's main languages - these are in fact GZDoom's ZScript and ACS files, treated as C# and C++ by GitHub Linguist respectively, for syntax highlighting purposes.
